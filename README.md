📱 SMS-Spam Detection System:-
The SMS-Spam Detection System is a Machine Learning-based project designed to classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam. By analyzing the text content of SMS messages, this system identifies patterns and behaviors that differentiate spam messages from legitimate ones, helping to filter unwanted messages and protect users from scams.

🧠 Project Objective:-
The main goals of the SMS-Spam Detection system are to:
1.Develop a predictive model to classify SMS messages as spam or non-spam.
2.Analyze SMS text data to uncover key features contributing to spam detection.
3.Visualize important aspects of the dataset for better understanding and decision-making.

📊 Data Visualization
The system includes the following types of visualizations to better understand the dataset:
📍 Word Cloud
Visualizes the most frequent words in spam and non-spam messages to uncover trends in word usage.
🔥 Bar Chart
Displays the count of spam vs. non-spam messages, helping to identify the distribution of the dataset.
📈 Histogram
Shows the message length distribution to understand how message length correlates with spam detection.
🔄 Confusion Matrix
Displays the performance of the classifier by comparing predicted vs. actual labels (spam/non-spam).
